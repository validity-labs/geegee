# Project Requirements
This project entails multiple milestones to be completed. For this first milestone we required the following smart-contracts to be developed in RUST with support for the NEAR blockchain.

## GeeBuck Token
The GeeBuck (GBK) is the native token for the GeeGee ecosystem. The token will be available on the NEAR blockchain.
We expect the token to have the fullowing functionalities:

- Max Supply: 1'000'000'000 (1 billion)
- ID: GBK
- Transferable (only within the GeeGee ecosystem)
- Burnable
- Pausable


## Ecosystem Reward Smart Contract
This smart contract will hold a total sum of 100'000'000 GBK token for distribution to Members.
It will send 50 GBK to every new member that has been placed to the white-list contract


## Whitelist Smart Contract
Every new user that has joined the GeeGee ecosystem will be added to the White-list with the following status:
New Member = 
Verified Member =
