# Environment setup

**All commands needs to be executed relative to the directory of this readme file**

We use a separate terraform configuration to create and maintain environments. This also includes creating the service account for the Gitlab CI and assigning the necessary permissions.
Doing this is necessary so that the service account used in the CI does not need cross-project permissions. Instead, the following commands must be executed manually by a GCP administrator account. It is required that the GCP user has the permission to create new projects and assign them to a billing account. Also, this user must have write permissions to the Google Cloud Storage bucket with the terraform state of the project.

If the project is newly created, the steps below [Initial setup](#initial-setup) must be executed first of all. Afterwards new environments can be created by following the instructions in the section [Creation of new environments](#creation-of-new-environments).
If this all is done, you can continue with [Infrastructure provisioning](#infrastructure-provisioning)

## Infrastructure provisioning

Requirements:

- Create a new file called `tf-backend-encryption-key` based on `tf-backend-encryption-key.example` under `extra/terraform/environment`, download the terraform backend encryption key from Bitwarden and insert the value into the file.
- Create a new tfvar file for secrets under `extra/terraform/environment/config` for each environment (`env_name-secrets.tfvars.example` to `<env>-secrets.tfvars`) and insert the required values
  - Gitlab access token: Create a new personal access token on gitlab.com (or use an existing one if you did that already)

Instructions:

1. Define variable with the new environment name (e.g. test, staging, prod, ...)

   ```bash
   export _ENV=<ENV>
   ```

2. Initialize terraform:

   ```bash
   docker run -i -t --rm \
      -u="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json":/google-credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/google-credentials.json" \
      -v "$(pwd)/":/srv \
      --workdir="/srv" \
      hashicorp/terraform:1.1.0 init -backend-config="./tf-backend-encryption-key"
   ```

3. Select the terraform workspace of the environment you want to deploy the changes to:

   ```bash
   docker run -i -t --rm \
      -u="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json":/google-credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/google-credentials.json" \
      -v "$(pwd)/":/srv \
      --workdir="/srv" \
      hashicorp/terraform:1.1.0 workspace select $_ENV
   ```

   You can list the available terraform workspaces with the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run -i -t --rm \
      -u="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json":/google-credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/google-credentials.json" \
      -v "$(pwd)/":/srv \
      --workdir="/srv" \
      hashicorp/terraform:1.1.0 workspace list
   ```

4. Check which changes are made when Terraform deploys the infrastructure:

   ```bash
   docker run -i -t --rm \
      -u="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json":/google-credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/google-credentials.json" \
      -v "$(pwd)/":/srv \
      --workdir="/srv" \
      hashicorp/terraform:1.1.0 plan -var-file="config/${_ENV}.tfvars" -var-file="config/${_ENV}-secrets.tfvars"
   ```

5. Perform deployment of infrastructure changes:

   ```bash
   docker run -i -t --rm \
      -u="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json":/google-credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/google-credentials.json" \
      -v "$(pwd)/":/srv \
      --workdir="/srv" \
      hashicorp/terraform:1.1.0 apply -var-file="config/${_ENV}.tfvars" -var-file="config/${_ENV}-secrets.tfvars"
   ```

## Creation of new environments

Requirements:

- Download the terraform backend encryption key from Bitwarden
- A personal gitlab access token

- Create a new file called `tf-backend-encryption-key` based on `tf-backend-encryption-key.example` under `extra/terraform/environment`, download the terraform backend encryption key from Bitwarden and insert the value into the file.
- Create a new tfvar file for secrets under `extra/terraform/environment/config` for each environment (`env_name-secrets.tfvars.example` to `<env>-secrets.tfvars`) and insert the required values
  - Gitlab access token: Create a new personal access token on gitlab.com (or use an existing one if you did that already)

Instructions:

**In case of authentication/permission issues please execute: `gcloud auth application-default login`**

1. Initialize terraform

   ```bash
   docker run -i -t --rm \
      -u="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json":/google-credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/google-credentials.json" \
      -v "$(pwd)/":/srv \
      --workdir="/srv" \
      hashicorp/terraform:1.1.0 init -backend-config=tf-backend-encryption-key
   ```

2. Define variable with the new environment name (e.g. test, staging, prod, ...)

   ```bash
   export _ENV=<ENV>
   ```

3. Check if the corresponding terraform workspace for the environment already exists

   ```bash
   docker run -i -t --rm \
      -u="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json":/google-credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/google-credentials.json" \
      -v "$(pwd)/":/srv \
      --workdir="/srv" \
      hashicorp/terraform:1.1.0 workspace list
   ```

   If this is not the case, proceed to the next step.

4. Create a new terraform workspace for the new environment

   ```bash
   docker run -i -t --rm \
      -u="$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
      -v "$HOME/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json":/google-credentials.json \
      -e "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/google-credentials.json" \
      -v "$(pwd)/":/srv \
      --workdir="/srv" \
      hashicorp/terraform:1.1.0 workspace new $_ENV
   ```

5. Create a `config/<environment>.tfvars` file for the environment that contains the required settings for the environment.

   ```bash
   vi config/$(terraform workspace show).tfvars
   ```

6. In the created file, all variables from the variables.tf file can now be assigned values for the corresponding environment. Make sure that the file does not contain any credentials!

   The content of the file could look like this afterwards: (TODO:)

   ```bash
   gitlab_project = "validitylabs/my/repo"
   reporting_engine_domain="api-<project-name>-<environment>.validity.io"
   ui_reporter_domain="<project-name>-<environment>.validity.io"
   ```

7. Create a `config/<environment>-secrets.tfvars` file for the environment that contains the required secrets for the environment (because they shouldn't be tracked in git).

8. Create a new personal access token on gitlab.com (or use an existing one if you did that already) and insert it into the `config/<environment>-secrets.tfvars`.

   ```bash
   vi config/$(terraform workspace show)-secrets.tfvars
   ```

9. If there are any other secret related variables in the variables.tf file, these needs to be added as well.

10. Follow the steps in section [Infrastructure provisioning](#Infrastructure-provisioning)

<!-- 11. Create cloud monitoring workspace @TODO: TBD

    Since there is currently no api for creating the monitoring workspace for the project, we need to that manually. In order to do so just open the Monitoring module in the Google Cloud Console in your browser

    https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring -->

11. Grant the service account for the Gitlab CI access to the domain of the current system in [google webmaster tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/details?hl=de)

Run the following command to get the email address of the gitlab ci service account: `terraform output --raw gcp_gitlab_ci_service_account_email`, or simply take a look at the apply command output you did before.

1.  Define Gitlab CI stage in the `gitlab-ci.yml` file if needed stage is not existent.

2.  Ensure in GitLab repository settings the branches and tags (use wildcard for tags like `*.*.*`) which are used for triggering the deployments are protected.

3.  Configure Cloudflare access in order to protect the access to test and staging environments.
    1.  Navigate to Access menu point on [CloudFlare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
    2.  Click on [Launch Zero Trust](https://dash.teams.cloudflare.com/)
    3.  Navigate to "Access / Applications" and add a new application
        1.  Choose self hosted
        2.  Copy & paste from any existing application to have the same settings
    4.  Repeat adding a new application on "Access / Applications" for the SSL challenge
        1.  Choose self hosted
        2.  Copy & paste from any existing application to have the same settings

## Initial setup

### Create terraform state bucket

In order to allow other people to be able to deploy infrastructure changes to projects using terraform, we need to store the terraform state in a central location.
For this we will create a Google Cloud Storage bucket in a general GCP project (for DAT AG it's called `dat-internal` and for Validity Labs `devops-252519`).

**Important: Each project should use a separate GCS bucket.**

1. Set the id of the gcp project in which the gcs bucket should be created:

   ```bash
   export GCP_PROJECT_ID=<gcp-project-id> # devops project id
   # export GCP_PROJECT_ID=devops-252519
   ```

2. Set the name of the project:

   ```bash
   export PROJECT_NAME=<project-name> # project name of the application
   # export PROJECT_NAME=geegee
   ```

3. Compose the bucket name including a random string which is used to make sure that the backup name is unique (command is probably only working on MacOS):

   ```bash
   export GCS_TERRAFORM_BUCKET_NAME="gs://$PROJECT_NAME-terraform-state-$(head -c 1024 /dev/urandom | base64 | tr -cd "[:lower:][:digit:]" | head -c 4)/"
   ```

4. Create the gcs bucket:

   ```bash
   gsutil mb -l EU -p $GCP_PROJECT_ID $GCS_TERRAFORM_BUCKET_NAME
   ```

5. Enable versioning:

   ```bash
   gsutil versioning set on $GCS_TERRAFORM_BUCKET_NAME
   ```

6. Open the main.tf file in the current directory and set the bucket name in the terraform configuration object.
   The object looks something like this and should be at the beginning of the file:

   ```bash
   ...

   terraform {
       # Configure gcs as the backend for the terraform state
       backend "gcs" {
           bucket = "<bucket-name>"
       }
   }

   ...
   ```

7. Create an customer supplied encryption key for the terraform state file inside the GCS bucket. For more instructions checkout: https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/using-customer-supplied-keys

You can use the keygen here: `node keygen.js` to obtain a newly created encryption key.

**Don't forget to add the encryption key to Bitwarden, we need the key later again!**

1. Create a file called `tf-backend-encryption-key` in the environment terraform module root directory and insert the following content (don't forget to replace `<replace-with-generated-encryption-key>` with the newly created key from the previous step):

   ```
   encryption_key="<replace-with-generated-encryption-key>"
   ```

### Set GCP billing account

Open the `variables.tf` file and search for `gcp_billing_account`.
Enter the correct GCP billing account ID as the default value.

Billing account ID for ValidityLabs: 01EF72-DEA514-1F5785
Billing account ID for DAT.AG: 01E854-E64B20-133EDB

### Create a resource folder in GCP for the projects

All GCP Project should be created in a resource folder for better organization. This folder must be created once initially.

1. Set organization id and project name

   ```bash
   # Validity Labs AG
   export GCP_ORGANIZATION_ID=960769728991

   # or

   # DAT AG
   export GCP_ORGANIZATION_ID=1066784281804
   ```

   ```bash
   export PROJECT_NAME=<project-name>
   # export PROJECT_NAME=geegee
   ```

2. Get the project folder id in order to check if the folder already exists

   ```bash
   gcloud resource-manager folders list --organization=$GCP_ORGANIZATION_ID --format="get(ID)" --filter=$PROJECT_NAME
   ```

   The command should return something like this: `folders/[folder-id]`. If that's the case, then add the folder number (after the slash) to your clipboard and _continue with step 4_.

   If the command returns nothing, the folder doesn't exist. In this case _continue with step 3_.

3. Create a new folder

   ```bash
   gcloud resource-manager folders create --display-name=$PROJECT_NAME --organization=$GCP_ORGANIZATION_ID
   ```

   Get the id of the new folder:

   ```bash
   gcloud resource-manager folders list --organization=$GCP_ORGANIZATION_ID --format="get(ID)" --filter=$PROJECT_NAME
   ```

   The command should return something like this: `folders/[folder-id]`. Add the folder number after the slash to your clipboard.

4. Open the file `extra/terraform/environment/variables.tf` and paste the content from your clipboard as default value of the variable `gcp_folder_id`.

### Set the project name in variables.tf

```bash
variable "gcp_project_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The name of the project."
  default     = "<project-name>"
  # default     = "geegee"
}
```

### Create Gitlab access token

1. Open https://gitlab.com/-/profile/personal_access_tokens and create a new access token with the following permissions: api, read_api

2. Save the access token in your personal password manager
